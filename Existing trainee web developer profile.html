<P>Matt James is one of many web developers we have at Hot Beans Web. He is working on lots of projects at the moment for our multiple clients and is currently leading two major projects for the company. Matt is a crucial part of the Hot Beans team and without developers like Matt we wouldn’t be able to produce outstanding content.</p>

<p>Amy Ryan is trainee web developer currently working under Matt James and is learning how we operate as a business. Amy is just one of many trainee web developers who are all just as excited as we are to join the team as full web developers.</p>
