<h2>Our history</h2>

<p> Hot Beans Web was set up in 2010 by Philip Heinz because of his passion for web development. He decided to set up the business after he couldn’t find anywhere to create his ideal website so he thought he could do it better. We came up with the name Hot Beans Web due to Philip second name “Heinz”.</p>

<p>In 2013 Philip finally moved the business from a small office in Chobham to a bigger office in Farnborough business park which allowed Philip to expand the business and increase the amount of clients we have.</p>
